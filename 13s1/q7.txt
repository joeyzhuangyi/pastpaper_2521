??
Every node (or implement in edges) has colour in black or red.
Balanced tree with the height of depth(highest path) <= 2 depth(lowest path)
Every insert, delete is O(log(n)).
Search would have a stable O(n log(n))

C.

No every. but if all the node has size 3 or 1 would have unique tree. Because the 2 size node can have different choice of black node.
