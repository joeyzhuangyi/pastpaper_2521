A.  Output the executable file which name is the following -- trav.
    Here is the explanation from man:
        Place output in file file.  This applies to whatever sort of output
        is being produced, whether it be an executable file, an object
        file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.

        If -o is not specified, the default is to put an executable file in
        a.out, the object file for source.suffix in source.o, its assembler
        file in source.s, a precompiled header file in source.suffix.gch,
        and all preprocessed C source on standard output.

B.  # gcc -c -o Graph.o Graph.c
    or: # gcc -c Graph.c

C.  When you use (gdb) run to run the programme, the execution will stop when every time the programme calling the myFun.
